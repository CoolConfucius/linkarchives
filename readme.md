# Link Archives 

Whether we use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer, we use bookmarks. 

Bookmarks are very useful for letting users quickly access frequently used links, but users may also bookmark links they find interesting or links they want to use later. This may include funny images or videos they want to share with others; or an article relevant to their work. 

Folders and subfolders can help with organizing the bookmarks. This is great especially when users use the same computer most frequently. 

However, users who often use different computers may not easily access the bookmarks stored on their local computer. Google has a feature that helps with this but not all users feel comfortable with it. 

An app called Delicious solves this problem. Users can make an account and add bookmarks to their account. Going a step further, users may view the most popular bookmarked links. A major flaw of Delicious is it didn't have folders for bookmarks. A user may search for bookmarks using tags, but with many bookmarks sharing the same tag, each bookmarks having multiple tags, a bookmark can still be hard to find. 

Despite this flaw, I used Delicious because no other app has accomplished this. Until Delicious shut down and its users lost all the bookmarks they saved. It's as if a library has been burnt down. 

Enter Link Archives. 
Like Delicious, users may create an account and add links. Different from Delicious, Link Archives have Link Collections. In addition to their tags, a link can belong to a Collection. Users may give their Collections: videos, images, or articles. Because of Collections, finding links is easier in Link Archives than in Delicious. 

In addition, users may view public Collections made by other users and add links to the Collections that are open to public. They may even add other user Collections to their favorites. 

Thank you!
